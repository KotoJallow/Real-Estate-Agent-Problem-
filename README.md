# Real-Estate-Agent-Problem
    
    
    A real estate agent routes his customers to houses and meets them to houseowners. Then he
    wants tenants to sort the houses according to their likes. He also wants houseowners to sort
    the tenants which they want to give their house most. After that, he assigns the tenants to
    houses considering their preferences to make them all satisfied. He is primarily considering
    the preferences of houseowners. He graduate from university as a software engineer but
    works as a real estate agent. So, he uses Gale Shapley algorithm to rent the houses to satisfy
    both houseowners and tenants.
